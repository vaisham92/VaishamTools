# VaishamTools
These are simple tools that I developed that I use for daily usages.


Combination generator: This tool can be used to generate permutation and combinations of different test cases. We can also download the generated test cases as a .csv file. I used bootstrap with Android's material design UX kit to develop this. I used Angular JS to code up the project. you can find the working model at: https://vaisham92.github.io/VaishamTools/CombinationGenerator/

BrahMos: This is a tool developed for analyzing the performance runs of a server. This tool can be used to generate and store graphs, performance KPI etc. we can maintain a dashboard with performance numbers
The technologies used in this are:
1. Java - Jersey, Spring, Hibernate
2. Angular JS
3. Bootstrap
4. MySql 5.6
